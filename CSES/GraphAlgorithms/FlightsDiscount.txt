Your task is to find a minimum-price flight route from Syrj채l채 to Mets채l채. You have one discount coupon, using which you can halve the price of any single flight during the route. However, you can only use the coupon once.
When you use the discount coupon for a flight whose price is x, its price becomes \lfloor x/2 \rfloor (it is rounded down to an integer).
